====================================
  CUSTOM SOUND SETUP (OPTIONAL)
====================================

The app currently uses a fallback web beep sound.
To add a custom notification sound:

STEP 1: Download a Sound File
------------------------------
Get a free notification sound from:
- https://freesound.org (search "notification bell")
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
- https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/notification/

Recommended sounds:
- https://freesound.org/people/JustInvoke/sounds/446111/ (Service Bell)
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/ (Various alerts)

Requirements:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 1-3 seconds
- Size: <100KB
- Volume: Moderate

STEP 2: Rename and Place File
------------------------------
Rename your downloaded file to: new_order.mp3

Place it in this directory:
  assets/sounds/new_order.mp3

STEP 3: Rebuild App
-------------------
flutter clean
flutter build web --release

STEP 4: Test
------------
1. Open merchant console
2. Click anywhere on the page (activates audio in browser)
3. Create a test order from customer app
4. You should hear your custom sound!

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If sound still doesn't play:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure you clicked the page first (browser autoplay policy)
3. Check file path is exactly: assets/sounds/new_order.mp3
4. Verify file size is <100KB

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
✅ Fallback beep is working (no file needed)
⏸️  Custom sound file NOT included (optional)

You can leave it as-is and the fallback beep will play!
